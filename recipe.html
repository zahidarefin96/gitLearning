    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol class="list">
      <li>If the turkey is frozen: Thaw in the fridge, 24 hours for every 5 pounds of Turkey. I like to give myself 1
        extra day, just to be safe.</li>
      <li>Remove the thawed turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting, to let it come to room temperature.</li>
      <li>Adjust your oven rack so the turkey will sit in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Make the herb butter by combining room temperature butter, minced garlic, salt, pepper, one tablespoon fresh
        chopped rosemary, one tablespoon fresh chopped thyme, and half a tablespoon of fresh chopped sage. </li>
      <li>Remove turkey from packaging and remove the neck and giblets from the inside the cavities of the bird.
        (Reserve
        them for gravy, if you want, or discard them). Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels.</li>
      <li>Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Stuff it with the quartered lemon, onion and apple and
        leftover herbs.</li>
      <li>Use your fingers to loosen and lift the skin above the breasts (on the top of the turkey) and smooth a few
        tablespoons of the herb butter underneath.</li>
      <li>Tuck the wings of the turkey underneath the turkey and set the turkey on a roasting rack inside a roasting
        pan*.
      </li>
      <li>Microwave the remaining herb butter mixture for 30 seconds (it doesn’t need to be completely melted--just
        really
        softened). Use a basting brush to brush the remaining herb butter all over the outside of the turkey, legs and
        wings.</li>
      <li>Roast at 325 degrees F for about 13-15 minutes per pound, or until internal temperature (inserted on middle of
        thigh and breast) reaches about 165 degrees.</li>
      <li>***Check the turkey about halfway through cooking, and once the skin gets golden brown, cover the top of the
        turkey with tinfoil, to protect the breast meat from overcooking. Alternately, you could start cooking the
        turkey
        with it tented in foil, then during the last hour or so of cooking you can take the foil off to let the turkey
        brown.</li>
      <li>Allow turkey to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.</li>
      <li>Reserve any drippings and juice remaining in your roasting pan to make turkey gravy.</li>
